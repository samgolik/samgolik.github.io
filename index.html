                <p>Hi there!

                    My name is Sam Golik and I'm a third-year student at The Ohio State University, where I'm majoring
                    in Computer Science
                    Engineering with a specialization in artificial intelligence. I'm a passionate computer science
                    student, actively
                    seeking new experiences and knowledge in computing.

                    I have experience in the software engineering industry through my role as a Mobile Development
                    Intern at Huntington
                    National Bank, and I bring to the table experience in mentorship and leadership in engineering at
                    Ohio State. I'm an
                    experienced programmer, with a strong background in Java, C, Python, and Ruby and recent experience
                    with mobile
                    development with Flutter and React.

                    I love talking all things software and AI. Feel free to connect and ask me what I'm working on!</p>
