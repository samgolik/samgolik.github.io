                <h2>
                    My name is Sam Golik, and I'm a software engineer. I'm currently working on my
                    Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, where I'm
                    specializing in artifical intelligence and minoring in mathematics. This summer, I'll also be a
                    software engineering intern at Capital One. Before this, I was an intern on the mobile development
                    team at Huntington National Bank.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    In terms of experience, I'm definitely still learning! I have a strong background in
                    object-oriented programming (Java/C/Python) as well as web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) through
                    my coursework, and experience with Flutter/Dart through my internship as well as personal projects.
                    I love learning new things and talking tech, so feel free to reach out!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    In my free time, I have my hands full with a variety of hobbies. I'm a musician, and I've been
                    playing
                    the violin for over 10 years. I still play in the Ohio State Symphony Orchestra! I also enjoy
                    playing
                    cello and piano. I like running and hiking, and have recently been getting into rock climbing
                    and disc golf. I'm originally from Cleveland and have two older brothers and a golden retriever
                    named Rigby.
